# Explainer Skill

This skill helps you explain code to workshop participants, focusing on clarity and learning.

## Instructions
1.  **Identify Context**: Determine the language, framework, and purpose of the code.
2.  **Break It Down**: specific explanations for complex lines or blocks.
3.  **Use Analogies**: highly encouraged to use real-world analogies (e.g., "This variable is like a backpack...").
4.  **Key Concepts**: Highlight important programming concepts used (e.g., Recursion, Async/Await).
5.  **Interactive**: Encourage the user to experiment with the code.

## Example
**User**: "What does `chmod +x` do?"
**Agent**: "`chmod` stands for **Change Mode**. It's like giving someone a key to a room. `+x` specifically adds the **Verify/Execute** permission, allowing the computer to run the file as a program, not just read it as text."
